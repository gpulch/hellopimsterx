This App was made as part of the recruiting process for the company Pimster.

It takes the SpaceX launches API and integrates it in a tile based front end.
It features a dynamic search bar, clickable tiles that show modals with launches infos and a bold neo brutalist design.
It was developped mobile first, and while responsive, the desktop version is subpar and I had very limited time so it isn't polished by any means.

It is build on Next.js with TypeScript. This was my first hands on with both of those.
